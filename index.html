        <h4>Experience</h4>
        <p class="accent-bar">
          Product Manager at <span class="ascension">Ascension</span>, where I led the development of an internal system that enabled Ascension insurance users to schedule and reschedule appointments, view billings, access dashboards, and manage their healthcare interactions more efficiently. I prioritized the product roadmap in collaboration with developers, aligning the product vision with market needs and business strategy. I successfully led 15+ product releases, oversaw major architectural transitions in Salesforce, and applied Agile methodologies to accelerate development cycles. Through UX enhancements using Figma and Miro, I improved customer satisfaction by 20% and optimized product performance through data-driven analysis. Additionally, I implemented SMS functionality via Twilio, developed go-to-market strategies, managed stakeholder expectations, and ensured continuous improvement by monitoring customer feedback. I also handled statewide community benefit data, generating insights through CBISA and other tools, and collaborated with the finance team for strategic budget planning.
        </p>
        <p class="accent-bar">
          Previously at <span class="medicallyhome">Medically Home</span>, where I worked on the product Cesia, which enabled hospital-level care to be delivered in patientsâ€™ homes. I supported product management leadership in defining requirements, designing features, and deploying updates, while demonstrating Cesia workflows to stakeholders with a focus on clinical safety and efficiency. I conducted market research to define customer segmentation and product value propositions, facilitated strategic workgroup meetings, and drove software development efforts through active participation in weekly scrum activities.
        </p>
